            Institutions are quickly embracing distance education in the forms of
online or web-based courses and programs at phenomenal rates. Often,
however, significant institutional structures, including such areas as registration,
advising, library, and technical support are overlooked until too late.
Institutions must have clear, well-planned strategies in place in order to
maximize their students’ learning experiences and overall satisfaction with
distance education programs to avoid attrition and maximize retention. This
chapter provides many useful and easy to implement strategies for institutions
considering distance education, as well as for those already engaged in
serving students online.<br>

            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>
            With the emergence of distance education in the form of web-based or
online education, new challenges materialize for students, faculty, and
institutions. These challenges range widely from adequate library support to
student mentoring and advising to institutional coherence and transparency in serving their distant students. This chapter provides an overview of best
practices—potential solutions to these many challenges.<br><br>
                This work has grown out of the author’s experience as a Distance
Education Coordinator and later as a faculty member teaching distance
courses. Distance education has reached yet another new phase, a phase
in which a systemic change in perspective must occur. Instead of maintaining
that it is the student who is remote or distant, institutions,
including faculty, staff, and particularly librarians and information specialists,
must see it is indeed they who are remote. These entities can begin
to address the many challenges surrounding efficacious distance education
programs by adopting a student-centered perspective in the institutional
approach to meeting distance education students’ needs. This
chapter must be considered a work in progress, as best practices for
intuitions must be revisited and continually revised as distance education
continues to mature and change. It is an attempt to raise awareness of
services and support that contribute to the most rewarding experiences for
distance education students. This chapter concentrates primarily on institutional
and library services, as best practices and guidelines for online
faculty and instructors can be easily identified in the literature.<br><br>
                Recent data from the National Center for Education Statistics (1997)
reveals great increases in the number of institutions offering distance education
programs or coursework. An analogous rise in formal, well-planned
institutional support policies appears to be missing, as many institutions
concentrate first and foremost on converting curriculum to an online format
and secondly on the delivery and technological infrastructure. However,
distance students need and deserve accommodations above and beyond their
on-campus counterparts; while many of these recommendations will apply to
and will assist all students, institutions must be cognizant of the extenuating
circumstances that contribute to a distant student’s frustrations, and in many
cases, attrition. The recommendations here are predicated on some institutional
monetary commitment as well, though many can be accomplished with
small budget lines. It is the hope of the author that institutions and programs
of all sizes can adapt the recommendations on a scale appropriate to them
while avoiding budgetary crises.<br><br>
                By initiating, maintaining, and guaranteeing a sound policy for services
and support of distance education students, an institution will promote the
most efficacious and enjoyable learning experience for every student—near
and far.

           <div class="hi1">
        <h2>FIRST STEPS</h2>
        <h5 style="font-size: 25px;">Planning</h5>
            <p>
            Institutions cannot jump into distance education without forethought and
careful preparation. Institutions must develop solid and strategic plans for
meeting the needs of distance students—including resources and services, not
only course delivery. To assess those needs, individual programs and the
institution as a whole should develop and administer student needs-surveys
on an annual or semiannual basis. To assist in the development of the needs
assessment, a distance education student advisory board comprised of four to
five students at various stages in the program or institution should be
established. The board should meet regularly through virtual means with key
players in the institution. The student advisory board serves as a liaison
between the students and the institution.<br><br>
                Communication is key, and all students need to know they have a voice
and a role in their educational process. Recall that typical characteristics of
distance students include being an adult in some form of employment and
moreover, they are characterized by autonomy, persistence, maturity and
independence, self-direction and motivation, and experience; as Schrum and
Luetkehans (1997) suggest, “The great majority of adults learning at a
distance were reported to be in the 20-40 age range and studying on a part-time
basis from their homes while maintaining full-time jobs” (p. 13). Institutions
should capitalize on this knowledge and experience of their distance students
in order to create an optimal learning environment; the student advisory board
contributes greatly to this environment.<br><br>
                Institutional goals and objectives must be clearly defined and how these
will be met according to an institutional timeline must be established. Again,
the distance student advisory board contributes to the formation and ongoing
assessment of the goals and objectives. The institution’s right hand must
know every move the left hand is making, to avoid problems such as incorrect
billing for out-of-state fees, requiring identification cards when a student may
never be on campus to acquire one, inconvenient course scheduling, sudden
technological changes in course delivery, among others. Student complaints
often revolve around a serious lack of institutional coherence and efficiency,
noting that calls (often long distance if a toll free number has not been
implemented) must be made to numerous offices in attempts to find the “right
person” for their particular questions. An institution must maintain a clear line
of contact for questions related specifically to distance education. In the
planning stages, institutions would be wise to identify the staff contacts for
particular issues and make this listing extremely easy to find and use; such a
listing should be maintained on the institution’s distance education Web pageand it should be mailed to every student with each semester’s registration
materials. Include such contacts as:<br>
1. Registration Questions<br>
2. Billing Questions<br>
3. Financial Aid Questions<br>
4. Course Access/Technical Questions<br>
5. Library Services<br>
6. Student Services (Advising, Book Store)<br>
Ideally, an “800” number will allow students to be transferred to the
appropriate contact at no additional cost to the student. Since 24/7 human
contact is most likely impossible, a voice recording of frequently asked
questions (FAQs) and answers should be available. A separate “Network
Operations” phone line should exist and alert students to scheduled downtimes
or unexpected network crashes. If students are unable to access their
online course, they should know why and for approximately how long. If
institutions do consider themselves as remote, time zones should be irrelevant
and complete access should be readily available for anyone at any time. This
is a service model towards which institutions are moving.<br><br>
                In addition, institutions should have mandatory staff briefings on their
distance education programs, so any individual is competent in answering
questions or referring students to the appropriate person. Staff should be
aware of distance offerings at the program, course, and non-degree levels;
residency, differences in tuition or billing, technology requirements, computer/
information literacy requirements must be understood. By allowing the
distance student advisory board to assist in the staff briefings through video
streams or net conferencing, staff will become immersed in the studentcentered
perspective and realize that there are many questions students
consider that the institution never has. Even if an individual is far-removed
from the operations of the distance program, she or he should be aware of the
institutional commitment to and investment in distance education. This is the
systemic change towards which institutions committed to distance education
will move.<br><br>
                Moreover, ongoing needs assessment, virtual focus groups, and pre- and
post-course surveys should be administered regularly so institutions remain
informed and able to meet the shifting needs of distance students. In particular,
the surveys should be available on the distance education Web page and
should ask for questions, concerns, or needs of students ahead of time.
Returning students could offer suggestions based on previous experience.
Anticipation of problems is key in the distance environment: time is of the
essence. As many involved in distance education know, if a problem causes a student to fall behind in course work, it becomes very difficult to catch up
in the fast-paced DE environment. The post-course survey would offer an
opportunity for students to evaluate the course, the professor, and the
institution, and encourage students’ suggestions for improvement. Of note,
since many faculty are learning how to teach online as they do it, student
recommendations for faculty provide significant information.<br><br>
                The maintenance of a distinct distance education Web page proves
critical. These Web pages should follow the guidelines of the Center for
Applied Special Technology for Accessibility (1997). Students should have
multiple means of access, including text-only versions of Web pages, voice
recordings, and easy access from the lowest modem rate connections and
computers that are not only state of the art. As the Web Accessibility Initiative
points out, “The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone
regardless of disability is an essential aspect” (http://www.w3.org/WAI/).
While many online course programs, including Blackboard, WebCT, and Top
Class currently fail to comply with the accessibility guidelines, institutions
should be demanding accessible software from vendors and requesting
significant improvements in this area. The main distance education information
pages are distinct from the Student Services Web page described below,
though both sites should be consistent in content, layout, form, and function.
Institutions may also wish to implement a standard template for course design,
based on the look and feel of the public Web pages, while still allowing faculty
artistic and intellectual individuality. Students will appreciate some conformity
and standards among course logins and modules.<br><br>
                Finally, institutions must ensure that students have immediate access to
all pertinent institutional information, including student handbooks (a separate
distance student handbook is encouraged), policy guidelines, support
services, contact information, and any other formal materials. While these
should be posted online, a paper copy must be sent to all distance students
immediately after the student contacts the institution for information.

           <div class="hi1">
       
            <h5 style="font-size: 20px;">Understand Distance Education and Its Specificity</h5>
            <p>
            As noted above, institutions must identify their key players in the distance
programs early on and staff briefings on the state of distance education should
be offered regularly. In order for distance students’ needs to be served in the
best possible way, faculty, librarians, and other key players at the host
institution need to understand and embrace distance education and its
particularities. Individuals responsible for working with the distance programs
must be introduced to its pedagogical specificity, characteristics of
students, technological mechanisms used in the course offerings, and the
distance program in general.<br><br>
                Understanding and staying informed are critical. Institutions and individuals
responsible for administering distance programs must become advocates
for distance education at the host institution and work to promote quality
and best practices throughout all aspects of the program. Anyone involved
must believe in what they are doing. Students quickly recognize when an
instructor or institution as a whole is disengaged from the philosophy of
distance education. All key players must receive appropriate training and
institutions should be prepared to hire more staff to meet the labor intensity
of distance education programming. Depending on the size of the institution,
number of students enrolled in the distance programs, number of courses
available, and support structures within individual programs, institutions can
formulate an appropriate ratio of support staff.<br><br>
                Likewise, students embarking on distance education should be aware of
the pedagogical specificity of this form of education. Buchanan (2000) has
suggested that students and faculty engage in pre-assessment tests to determine
their suitability in a web-based environment. Institutions may want to be
less formal and instead have a question on application materials that simply
asks, “Why is distance education right for you?”2 . This will encourage
distance students to consider their commitment to distance education in a
nonthreatening manner. Guest access to online courses, with prospective
students encouraged to examine a course prior to enrollment is recommended
in order to allow students to make informed decisions concerning the
appropriateness of distance education for them.

            <div class="hi2">
      
            <h2>IMPLEMENTATION</h2>
            <h4 style="font-size: 22px;">Efficient and Effective Communication and Support</h4>
            <p>
            Distance students rely on efficient communication in the forms of email, chat
rooms, toll-free phone lines, faxes, or other electronic means as their academic
lifelines. Lack of clear communication feeds into student dissatisfaction and
ultimately, attrition. As more institutions and for-profit ventures offer distance
education, students do not have to settle for inadequate services—they have
choices and will explore them if an institution cannot or will not meet their needs.<br><br>
                A 24/7 service should be offered. Institutions should advise students to
leave their time zone when making requests or inquiries so proper response
times can be established. As part of staff development, individuals should
learn the basics of computer-mediated communication. For instance, in the
library setting, librarians should be trained on virtual bibliographic instruction,
including virtual reference interviews. Individuals working with distance
students must learn more effective interviewing techniques in the
absence of voice intonation or facial and body expression.<br><br>
                Academic advisors working with distance students must learn the
emerging legal issues surrounding student records privacy. Advisors should
exercise caution when sending personal information to a distance student who
uses a family email account, for instance. Headers indicating “This message
is intended for—and may contain confidential information for that individual
only” should be used. All correspondence should be thoroughly documented,
and upon completion of telephone discussions with distance students, advisors
or other individuals should write a report of the conversation, send it to
the student for confirmation, and place it in the student file.<br><br>
                Importantly too, advisors must explore creative ways of advising students
at a distance, many of whom are changing careers. Institutions must
consider video streams and/or archived video files of student services such as
resume writing, job hunting, and the like.<br><br>
                To assist with student advising and peer networking, institutions should
develop a voluntary peer mentor system. This is simple and extremely costeffective:
The institutional distance education coordinator maintains a database
of students and their status in the program (how many courses taken) and
he/she will coordinate pairs of mentor/mentees. When a new student enrolls,
he/she should be paired with a veteran DE student who has agreed to serve as
a mentor. Emails and phone numbers should be exchanged. The mentor can
share process advice, technological advice, and student support. Remember
that attrition rates remain high in distance education programs (See for
instance, Terry, 2001; Carr, 2000; Morgan & Tam, 1999); this peer relationship
may help curb this by providing an informal networking and peer support
system within a program. The mentee can feel comfortable asking a peer for
advice on the ins and outs of the DE program, securing materials, course
participation, and maneuvering through the institutional channels.<br><br>
                Finally, distance students need syllabi, reading lists, other resourceslists,
and course access available at least three weeks prior to the inception of a
class. Faculty teaching distance education must be alerted to this, and they
must be able to comply; teaching online requires great planning, organization,
and forethought. Faculty cannot expect to “wing it” online, and an institutional
commitment to a rigorous timeline for distance programs may alleviate
many common complaints of online faculty and coursework. While faculty
may complain about this additional burden, preparedness is a major key in
successful distance education.<br><br>
                This enables students to prepare, gather materials through whatever
means necessary, work out technical glitches in access and course participation,
and be ready to engage in the actual learning process when the course
begins. Since many distance students need to acquire course materials through interlibrary loan, purchase through an online or campus bookstore, or
download materials from online resources, three weeks provides ample time.
If faculty recognize that they have large files to download, a CD-ROM or other
format option should be available.

            <div class="hi2">
      
           
            <h4 style="font-size: 24px;">Student-to-Student Services</h4>
                <p>In addition to student mentoring, the host institution should establish a
course module for Student-to-Student Services for use only by students. This
is a place where students can sell or trade course texts with each other, share
group information; it serves as a virtual lounge. The Student Services site is
both formal and informal, serving to unite distance students in a friendly way,
as well as serving as a formal point of information dissemination.<br><br>
                FAQs (in nontechnical language) can be posted within the module;
course schedules, syllabi and readings lists, and other institutional information
can be disseminated easily. Anonymous postings on a bulletin board
should be allowed, however, guidelines for responsible and appropriate use
of the forums must be established. Distance students should have the same
safe place to talk about instructors, courses, or other issues as on-site students
who whisper to each other before or after classes in the hallways. The distance
education coordinator should monitor the module and update it regularly,
however, the coordinator must respect the rights and privacy of distance
students’ and their communications.<br><br>
                    To keep this student site most effective, define the goals and objectives
of the site, and remain focused on that audience and those objectives as the site
materializes. The distance student advisory board will be active in the creation
and ongoing revisions of the site. All distance students should be polled on
what kinds of information they would find useful and valuable on the site, and
key players from the institution should be polled on the types of questions to
which they frequently respond.<br><br>
                    The site must comply with accessibility guidelines, and it must be
designed based on feedback from distance students and graduates. Keep the
perspective entirely student-centered. Do a rough web-ready version of the
general structure and post it to the Web and ask your student advisory board
to provide feedback. Revise as needed. The site should be readily available to
students, and it should be a “one-stop shop.” Ongoing maintenance is
requisite, and in the institutional goals and objectives, a revision schedule for
the student services website must be established and adhered to. Continue to
be mindful of the initial objectives and audience so that the site does not
gradually stray from its intended purpose.<br><br>
                </p>
           </div>
           <div class="hi2">
      
            
            <h4 style="font-size: 27px;">LIBRARY AND INFORMATION RESOURCES</h4>
               <p>Finally, library services and support for distance education must be
considered. The Association of College and Research Libraries’ guidelines
(1998) define distance education library services as “those library services in
support of college, university, or other post-secondary courses and programs
offered away from a main campus, or in the absence of a traditional campus,
and regardless of where credit is given…The phrase is inclusive of courses in
all post-secondary programs designated as: extension, extended, off-campus,
extended campus, distance, distributed, open, flexible, franchising, virtual,
synchronous or asynchronous.” The ACRL’s guidelines are a major step in
the appropriate provision of services for distance students. They address eight
main areas:<br>
1. Management<br>
2. Finances<br>
3. Personnel<br>
4. Facilities<br>
5. Resources<br>
6. Services<br>
7. Documentation<br>
8. Library Education<br>
                   Ultimately, the guidelines call for libraries and information centers to
assume a new-found and prominent role in light of distance education.
Libraries are integral to the institution as a whole and should work in close
collaboration with their parent institutions in the development and delivery
of distance education. Just as libraries must engage in collection
development for any institutional programs, the library must be active in
determining how it will meet the needs of off-campus students through
collection development. As distance education continues to lack credence
in some circles, a proactive library and library staff can contribute to a
sound pedagogical experience for students by ensuring high-quality,
scholarly materials in a number of formats. It cannot be assumed that
distance students can acquire scholarly materials easily through their local
libraries or “online.” Mechanisms must be established to ensure quality
resources for all students.

            <h4 style="font-size: 27px;">Partnerships and Relationships with Multiple Libraries</h4>
               <p>While politics and the mighty dollar still prohibit true resource sharing
across states and even within states, advances are being made through
different means such as the Z39.50 information retrieval protocol, interlibrary
loans, and commercial enterprises. The impetus falls on the delivering institution, however, to contact local libraries where their distance students
live, and to provide information on the types of resources that would be
needed locally for the student. Depending on the size of the distance education
program, this may prove impossible, but institutions must recognize that they
need to support the student. If the institutional library does not make resources
available electronically or through delivery mechanisms, some formal channels
of communication should occur to provide a solid library and information
resource base. For instance, the Open University partners with the Indiana
University library system, and other consortial agreements are emerging as
beneficial for meeting distance education students’ information needs.</p>
           </div>
           <div class="hi2">
      
            
            <h4 style="font-size: 27px;">Electronic Resources Available Easily and Efficiently</h4>
               <p>More specifically, libraries can engage in best practices that will provide
efficient and effective use by their distance students. A reliable electronic
reserve system should be established with respect to the emerging copyright
laws (see the Digital Millennium Copyright Act for details). The e-reserve
system must be kept updated, with each semester’s materials available well
ahead of the course inception (three weeks). The system’s downtime, if any,
must be minimal, with advance notice to students of the scheduled downtime.
Information concerning the library’s network should be updated on the
“Network Operations” line mentioned earlier.<br><br>
                   Documents available for electronic reserve must be of superior quality;
the scans should be done at the highest possible resolution, with large
documents separated into parts, with file size indicated. Articles’ “black
space,” the result of poor photocopying, should be trimmed to save students’
printer ink. Provide a chart of download times for different access rates. If a
student cannot obtain the electronic reserve materials, mechanisms for
sending a paper copy or CD-ROM must be in place.<br><br>
                   Students must have 24/7 access to online indexes and databases, preferably
full text if possible. Importantly, the library must know what programs
and courses are available throughout the institution so that temporary license
agreements can be established if students will need particular resources.
Verification of students can be ensured through proxy servers or other secure
logins. Automation systems that allow browsing of “shelves” and in particular,
tables of contents are desirable. Catalogers are now regularly using a
variable length contents field (the 505 field) for MARC records that enables
tables of contents to be included in records. This is particularly valuable for
distance students who may need to request a book, only to receive it two weeks
later to find it is inappropriate. Libraries may also want to explore links to
book reviews and other authoritative sources within their circulation systems.
